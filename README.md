This is my NEA project for my 2025 Computer Science A-Level, My project consists of building a Convolutional Neural Network capable of classifying between 5 flowers and analysing how the performance
varies with the different number of layers and kernels without using extrenal libraries like pytorch, tensorflow, or numpy.

It will use Convolutional, Dense, and MaxPooling layers, ReLU and Softmax activation functions, Categorical Crossentropy Loss and a minibatch gradient descent optimizer without momentum for training.
