This is my NEA project for my 2025 Computer Science A-Level, My proyect consists of building a Convolutional Neural Network capable of classifying between 5 flowers and analysing how the performance
varies with the different number of layers and kernels without using extrenal libraries like pytorch, tensorflow, or numpy.
